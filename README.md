# AffiliateBot

This bot functions as a scanner for Affiliate base content within submissions and comments.

It is based on the bot we use at https://www.reddit.com/r/GameDeals for reporting spam and other content, while it is not the exact same bot, I will keep this updated with most of the features we use.

The bot does not require any form of subreddit moderator permissions and will report submissions and comments in the following format `Bot Report: REASON`.

When a Submission or a Comment is submitted within the chosen subreddit, the bot will extract all the URL's check the URL and also check the content of the linked sites to check for Affiliate based information and Report the Submission or Comment based on it's findings, it is not always 100% correct and still requires manual interaction before you make you choice to remove or approve.

If you need any help to configure, or hosting the bot you are welcome to context me directly on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/dgc1980/).
